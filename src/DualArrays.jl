    DualArrays

A Julia package for efficient automatic differentiation using dual numbers and dual arrays.

This package provides:
- `Dual`: A dual number type for storing values and their derivatives
- `DualVector`: A vector of dual numbers represented with a Jacobian matrix
- `DualMatrix`: A matrix of dual numbers represented with a Jacobian tensor`
- `ArrayOperator`: A data structure that stores an array equipped with an output and input dimension.
    Useful for tensor computations involving higher order DualArrays
Differentiation rules are mostly provided by ChainRules.jl.
